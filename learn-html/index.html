    <p>The <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/#mars_exploration_program/0" title="Mission Statement">goal</a> of the Mars Exploration Program is to explore Mars and to provide a continuous flow of scientific information and discovery through a carefully selected series of robotic orbiters, landers and mobile laboratories interconnected by a high-bandwidth Mars/Earth communications network.</p>
    <p>There are several strategic, practical and scientific <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/#mars_exploration_program/3" title="Why Mars?">reasons for humans to explore Mars</a>. Among them we know that Mars is the most accessible place in the solar system. Additionally, exploring Mars provides the opportunity to possibly answer origin and evolution of life questions, and could someday be a destination for survival of humankind.</p>
